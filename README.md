# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a content-based recommendation system that suggests movies based on their similarity in attributes such as genres, cast, keywords, and crew. It uses cosine similarity on movie attributes to provide recommendations. The dataset is sourced from TMDB (The Movie Database), making this system suitable for creating a robust movie recommendation model.

## Dataset

### TMDB Movie Dataset

The dataset contains 930,000 movies from TMDB, available on Kaggle. It includes features such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and more. You can download it here: [TMDB Movie Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies).

**File**: `TMDB_movie_dataset_v11.csv`

#### Key Features in the Dataset:
- `id`: Unique movie ID
- `title`: Movie title
- `genres`: List of genres associated with the movie
- `keywords`: Keywords relevant to the movie's content
- `vote_average`: Average vote or rating given by viewers
- `revenue`: Total revenue generated by the movie
- `overview`: Short description of the movie plot

The dataset will be processed to calculate similarity scores and generate recommendations.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to recommend movies based on cosine similarity between different movies' features. By comparing attributes such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew, the system suggests movies that are closest in content and style to the selected movie.

### Key Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends similar movies based on their content.
- **Euclidean distance**: Calculates the distance between movies by transforming their features into vectorized forms.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Outputs a list of the closest movies based on the movie title input.
